1. What Are User Stories?
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who needs it—usually a user or customer.

They help teams:

Understand who wants something
What they want
Why they want it

Standard User Story Format

A widely used template is:
As a [type of user]
I want [some goal or action]
So that [benefit or reason]

Example:
As a customer, I want to save items to a Wishlist so that I can purchase them later.
This format ensures the story stays user-focused and intention-driven rather than technical.
2. How to Write Effective User Stories

Effective user stories have several characteristics:

A. Focus on the User

The story should describe value from the user’s point of view.
Avoid technical descriptions (“As a database…”).

B. Keep Them Short and Simple

A single sentence in the standard format should capture the essence.
Details go into acceptance criteria, not the story itself.

C. Follow the INVEST Criteria
| Letter | Meaning     | Description                                       |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **I**  | Independent | Can be developed separately from others           |
| **N**  | Negotiable  | Not overly detailed; can be discussed and refined |
| **V**  | Valuable    | Provides value to the user                        |
| **E**  | Estimable   | The team can estimate the effort                  |
| **S**  | Small       | Can be completed in a single iteration            |
| **T**  | Testable    | Has clear acceptance criteria                     |

D. Ensure They Describe a Single Piece of Value

Avoid combining multiple goals in one story.
Use separate stories if the user goals differ.

E. Collaborate When Creating Stories

User stories work best when created with:

Product owner
Developers
Designers
QA testers
Stakeholders

3. What Are Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance criteria are conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete.

They describe:
Functional requirements (What the system must do)
Non-functional requirements (Performance, usability, etc.)
Scenarios to validate the story

Why Acceptance Criteria Are Important

✔ Clarify expectations — ensures everyone understands what “done” means
✔ Support testing — provide the basis for test cases
✔ Reduce ambiguity — eliminates assumptions
✔ Enable accurate estimates — teams know exactly what needs to be built
✔ Improve quality — by ensuring all edge cases and requirements are defined

Examples of Acceptance Criteria

Format 1: Bullet List

Users must be able to click a “Save to wishlist” button

The item should appear in the wishlist page

The wishlist must persist when the user logs out
